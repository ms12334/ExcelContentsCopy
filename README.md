UserForm was used this time.  I changed some properties along the way. So you cannot simply copy/paste the source code with recreated form (frm3) will not be good enough to run this. Copy settings Excel file needs to have Sheet1 with source sheet name in column A, source range in column B, target sheet name in column C, target range in column D.  Column E will be filled out with status.
